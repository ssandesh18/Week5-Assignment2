    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, exceptions are just regular classes that inherit from the Exception class. This makes it super easy to create our own custom exceptions, which can make our programs easier to follow and more readable. An exception need not be complicated, just inherit from Exception:\n",
    "It’s OK to have a custom Exception subclass that only pass-es - your exception doesn’t need to do anything fancy to be useful. Having custom exceptions - tailored to your specific use cases and that you can raise and catch in specific circumstances - can make your code much more readable and robust, and reduce the amount of code you write later to try and figure out what exactly went wrong.\n",
    "Of course, you can get as fancy as you want. You can send additional information, like messages, to your exceptions. Just add an __init__() method to your exception class, with whatever arguments you want.\n",
    "Exception takes an optional string argument message that gets printed with your exception. We pass our erroneous value to our IncorrectValueError object, which constructs a special message and passes it its parent class, Exception, via super().__init__(). The custom message string, along with the value for context, gets printed along with our error traceback.\n",

    "Q2. Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# import inspect module \n",
    "import inspect \n",
    "  \n",
    "# our treeClass function \n",
    "def treeClass(cls, ind = 0): \n",
    "    \n",
    "      # print name of the class \n",
    "    print ('-' * ind, cls.__name__) \n",
    "      \n",
    "    # iterating through subclasses \n",
    "    for i in cls.__subclasses__(): \n",

    "Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "ArithmeticError\n",
    "The ArithmeticError exception class serves as a base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised due to various arithmetic errors like OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError, FloatingPointError.\n",
    "What is ZeroDivisionError?\n",
    "A ZeroDivisionError in Python occurs when we try to divide a number by 0. We can’t divide a number by 0 otherwise it will raise an error. Let us understand it with the help of an example. In this example, we are dividing a number from 0 and we can see that it raises a ZeroDivisionError.\n",

    "a=20\n",
    "b=0\n",
    "print(a/b)\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating-point errors arise because computers store real numbers using a finite number of bits, leading to approximations and potential inaccuracies. Floating-point numbers have intrinsic limitations:\n",
    "•\tFinite precision: Only a limited number of digits can be stored in the significand, leading to rounding errors when representing exact decimals.\n",
    "•\tLoss of precision: Operations like addition or subtraction can further reduce precision, compounding the effects of rounding.\n",
    "•\tUnderflow/Overflow: Extremely small or large numbers can fall outside the representable range, leading to underflow (becomes zero) or overflow (becomes infinity).\n",
    "\n",
    "decimal_number = 0.1\n",
    "binary_representation = format(decimal_number, '.30f') # 30 decimal places\n",
    "print(f\"Decimal: {decimal_number}\\nBinary: {binary_representation}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\n",
    "LookupError Exception is the Base class for errors raised when something can’t be found. The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid: IndexError, KeyError.\n",
    "An IndexError is raised when a sequence reference is out of range.\n",
    "The given code is rewritten as follows to catch the exception and find its type\n",
    "Example\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "try:\n",
    "foo = [a, s, d, f, g]\n",
    "print foo[5]\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "print e\n",
    "print sys.exc_type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",
    "Two such errors that developers often come across are ModuleNotFoundError and ImportError. In this guide, we’ll explore what these errors are, the common problems associated with them, and provide practical approaches to resolve them.\n",
    "What are ModuleNotFoundError and ImportError?\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError: This error occurs when Python cannot find the module specified in the import statement. It could be due to the module not being installed or the Python interpreter not being able to locate it in the specified paths.\n",
    "ImportErrorare: This error is more generic and can occur for various reasons, such as a module within a package not being found, an incorrect module name, or issues with the module itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "•\tKeep try blocks small and focused to properly handle exceptions\n",
    "•\tCatch specific exceptions instead of generic Exception class to differentiate errors\n",
    "•\tPrint custom error messages from except blocks upon failures\n",
    "•\tUse finally clause to execute sections of cleanup code reliably\n",
    "•\tDefine custom exception classes to match application scenarios\n",
    "•\tUse try-except blocks only where needed.\n",
    "o\tDon’t wrap your entire code in a massive try-except block; limit it to potential error-prone sections.\n",
    "o\tDon’t overuse try-except blocks in business logic to avoid hiding real issues\n",
    "o\tAvoid using except: without specifying the exception type, as it can catch unintended errors.\n",
    "•\tUse logging to record exceptions for later analysis.\n"
